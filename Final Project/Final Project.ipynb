    "### How the scheduler works\n",
    "We are given a set of n activities with start time, duration, and the profit associated with executing the activity. We want to get such subset of $x$ activites that is $x<=n$, does not contain overlapping activities, and that maximizes the maximum profit from all the activities performed. To start off, we need to sort our activities by their end time, which we calculate by adding the duration to the start time. Sorting the input in such a way allows us to use the Dynamic Programming. We have two variables: i, and j, which will be used to change the subsets of activites that we analyze. We also define a function $p(j)$, which will constitute the rightmost activity $i$, where $i$ and $j$ are non-overlapping and $i<j$. Using this function will give us the first activity to the left of $j$ that isn't overlapping with it. For the purpose of locating this activity, we could use different approaches, however, binary search significantly decreases the running time. If we used an iterative solution, our algorithm could yield even $O(n*2^n)$ time complexity which is extremely unfavorable. Solution bsed on binary search gives us $O(nlog(n))$ complexity - because we run binary search over all $j$'s, whose amount is $n$ - therefore, $nlog(n)$. Next, we can infer that the last rightmost subset of activities either is a part of globally optimal solution or is not. Such a dichotomy leads us to two cases: if $n$ is a part of the optimal solution, then none of the smaller subsets will be better than the result from this solution (since all the other subsets are just subsets of $n$). On the contrary, if $n$ does not belong to the optimal solution, then we know that our optimal solution has to be somewhere in the smaller subset of activities being $ 1, 2, ..., p(n)$. These two cases support the idea that this problem reflects the optimal subproblem structure. Also, knowing them, allows us to formulate a strategy for finding the globally optimal solution using the Dynamic Programming. We will look at the bigger and bigger subsets at each iteration and at each step save the best potential solution out of the two cases (starting from subset of 1 activity and ending with all of them). In other words, we will look for the optimal solution by taking the maximum out of the two cases, as represented in this pseudocode: $optimum(j)=maximum(profit_j + optimum(p(j)), ooptimum(j-1))$. While solving the recurrence, we will store the results in a table for the purposes of memoization. In the last step, these memoized subsolutions are used "

    "### Scheduler's Time Complexity Analysis\n",
    "Let's start with decomposing our algorithm and analyzing the time complexity of its chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, we are sorting the activities by their end times. Depending on the algorithm we choose, the time complexity will differ. In this case, we use the python built-in function .sort, which by default uses quicksort. Hence, its time complexity will be: $\\Omega(nlog(n))$, $\\Theta(nlog(n))$, $O(n^2)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, we calculate the values for the $p$ function. Using the binary search method, as me ntioned in the upper part, yields $O(logn)$ complexity. Since we do it for all the $n$ number of items, we have to multiply the complexities, reaching $O(nlog(n))$.\n",
    "- Using the memoization and bottom-up approach, we get the linear $O(n)$ time complexity of calculating the values of all the optimal subproblems.\n",
    "-In the last step, we traverse the list of solutions to subproblem, which also has a linear time $O(n)$.\n",
    "Finally, we are able to get the time complexity of the entire algorithm. It is dominated by the $O(nlog(n))$ complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the space complexity, our algorithm is also doing quite well. It is not working in the in-space manner, meaning that it needs additional space than only that taken by the input. It is because the algorithm uses the memoization technique. However, maintianing this table will still be much less space demanding than e.g. using a dataframe for a scheduler, as was in my LBA scheduler implementation."

    "There are multiple problems with the algorithm I used for the LBA assignment. They will be named and discussed below:\n",
    "- Strong dependency of the algorithm on the input: Between the lines 169 and 207, I had a part of the algorithm that used the names from the input to create heaps. When the input changed, the function was useless and the part of the code had to be updated accordingly to the input. In my next iteration of the scheduler, I will avoid such dependency on the input, which will make the algorithm more robust.\n",
    "- No time-constraints: This algorithm was primarily designed to schedule the long-term activities. My purpose was to schedule the tasks I wanted to accomplish in the 4 months period in Seoul. Because of that, the algorithm assumed unlimited time and only ordered the tasks based on their priority. However, such implementation will not yield correct results if we wanted to use it as a daily tasks scheduler. This flaws of the LBA's algorithm can be reflected by the amount of time the scheduler advices to use in a day. In case of this input, it is 1175 minutes = 19.5 hours. This is an unlikely schedule (and definitely not a favorable and sustainable to live by in a long-term one) since we have only 5.5 hours of sleep left. In our updated scheduler, we will want to use the time constraint to prevent from such a thing happening and automatically leave some time for rest. We can therefore imagine a potential solution. One of them could be to constrain each of the activities to be less than 16 hours. Also, we will need to ensure that there are no activities that are both non-overlapping, and happen towards the end of our 16hr period, since that would result in the algorithm crossing this threshold.\n",
    "- Poorly organized schedule: In this scheduler, I have such nonsense output pieces, as reflecting on the day as only a third task within a day (meaning that after 2.5 hours after waking up we would need to reflect on the day given we followed the scheduler). Also, the algorithm advises to meet the Civic Partner in a late night - in 18th hour of the day. In the updated scheduler, I will try to avoid such absurd schedules. It will mainly be done by implementing the start-times that were used in the first part of this assignment - if the algorithm decides not to include a specific task that needs to happen at the beginning of the day, it will simply not be included at all in the schedule, rather than being pushed at the end.\n",
    "- Huge space inefficiency - In this implementation, I was storing my data in a DataFrame. Even though this data structure can be very useful for specific purposes (manipulating the data, analyzing it, etc.), in our case we don't use its functionality, while suffering from its disadvantages. Changing this datastructure to a different one will yield a better space efficiency. In my case, even a terribly poor use of memory will not constitute a problem because the data is relatively small. However, if we wanted to implement our algorithm on a larger scale (e.g. because we want to develop a scheduler app and put it on the market for public use), we would be highly concerned with how much memory we need to serve our customers.

For that reason, it does not matter what dependencies the tasks have on one another - the ones that have a dependency will be executed before the ones without dependencies. The more dependencies the task has, the lower in the priority queue it ought to be\n",
    "- I will combine two solutions from the previous part. I will use the algorithm from the first question to decide which activities will be executed and the priority queue to schedule the order in which the tasks within this activity will be executed.\n",
    "- To avoid making irrelevant computations, I will firstly get the schedule of all the activities that our algorithm decides to execute, and then compute the priority queue for tasks within these activites.

    "- First, we are resolving the tasks that can be multitasked. In this part, we run three nested loops, suggesting the $O(n^3)$ time complexity. However, in reality, one of the loops runs through activities, while the other two run through the tasks. Hence, if we consider our $n$ to be the number of tasks across all the activities, the time complexity of this part of the algorithm is $O(n^2)$. \n",
    "- Next, the $get end time$ function runs through all the tasks within each activity, resulting in the linear $O(n)$. \n",
    "- Next, we call the $schedule weighted activities$ function, which runs in $O(nlog(n))$.\n",
    "- Next, we run a nested loop with the heapifying inside of one of the loops. However, similarly to what was happening when we had a triple nested loop, one of the loops runs through activities, while the other over tasks, resulting in $O(n)$. Within the loop running through activities, we create a heap for all the tasks of an activity by pushing each of the tasks to the heap. This operation has an average time complexity of $O(1)$, and the worst-case of $O(log(n))$. Hence, our time complexity of creating the heap is $O(n)*O(log(n))=O(nlog(n))$. \n",
    "- Finally, we run a loop through all the tasks within the selected activity and heappop the first task in a priority queue, which takes $O(n)$ for the loop multiplied by $O(log(n))$ from the heappop function, resulting in the final $O(nlog(n))$.\n",
    "As we can see, the biggest time complexity is taken by the part of function that resolves the multitasking. Overall, the algorithm has $O(n^2)$ time complexity. From that, we can infer that it is not the best possible algorithm and some improvements in the way the multitasks are handled could reduce the complexity to logarithmic. However, we can still se the improvement from the function used in the LBA assignment, which was running in $O(n^2log(n))$ (because double nested loop with heap opertions within the inner one). \n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to the space complexity, the use of heap data structure for priority queue helps us save the space, since heaps operate in $O(n)$ space complexity (are in-place). Also, storing the tasks within activities with the use of a class gives us an improvement from the LBA assignment, where the pandas DataFrames were used."

    "### Discussion of the Improved Scheduler\n",
    "Firstly, it is worth noting that the Improved Scheduler is more advanced than the Activity Scheduler from the first part of this assignment since it incorporates not only the activities but also the tasks within them. The lack of time constraint that was present in the LBA scheduler is solved by both proper input format, and the fact that the Improved Scheduler 'drops' the tasks that are overlapping rather than just scheduling them one by one. There are, however, a couple of flaws of the new algorithm. One of them is that the multitasking is resolved in a way that any of the multitasking tasks can not be executed over multiple other multitasking tasks. In other words, the multitasking can only happen between two tasks and the longer one can't be divided and spread across a couple of tasks with multitasking enabled. That yields to some time inefficiency in the scheduler. If we had an optimal solution, it could be the case that the activities scheduler would find the time to execute at least one more activity within a day. Also, there are a couple of multitasking tasks that could've been executed across multiple other activities. An example of such could be listening to a podcast - I could start listening to it at the gym, continue during the shower, and finish while preparing a breakfast. Incorporating that in the algorithm could also save us some time and make the scheduler more optimal. Also, it might be the case, that a poorly designed input could yield an incorrect priority queue of the tasks. It could happen if the dependencies and priorities were assigned such as the tasks that have a certain dependency are executed before the tasks that they are dependent on. It is because the algorithm does not create a network of dependencies, which would make it 'smart' in a way that it knows which tasks have to be executed before which other ones. Instead, currently, this problem is resolved by assigning certain priorities to the tasks based on their dependencies. "
